# FAISS_RecSys_Master

FAISS, short for Facebook AI Similarity Search, is an open-source library created by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) to facilitate efficient similarity search and clustering of high-dimensional vectors. It is designed to excel in situations with extensive datasets and high-dimensional feature vectors, which are frequently encountered in tasks like image and text retrieval, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.

Here we are using a small dataset of book titles and their descriptions for our use-case which is to leverage FAISS for efficient vector similarity search in order to develop a recommendation system.
